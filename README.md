# Kaavish-VirtualSelfDefenseTrainer

This repository contains all the code files and documents of our final year project.

A virtual self defense trainer was targeted.

Me along with my team implemented the software and hardware aspects and the codebase is stored here.

My main focus was the functionality of the hardware with some input in the scoring mechanism and algorithms.
